Installation via conda
======================
TempestExtremes can be found on conda-forge here:

https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/tempest-extremes

To install from conda use the command line:

```conda install -c conda-forge tempest-extremes```

Installation via make
=====================
TempestExtremes uses a basic make-based build system that has been tested in multiple Unix and Linux based environments.  TempestExtremes currently only requires the NetCDF C library provided as an external dependency.  Linker commands needed to include -lnetcdf must be specified in a system makefile found in mk/system/.  Once the compiler executable and flags have been set, executing "make" in the tempestextremes directory will perform the build, storing binaries in the "bin" directory.

To compile on NERSC Cori:
Execute "module load cray-netcdf" prior to compilation.  Compiler executable and flags are specified in mk/system/cori.make.

To compile on NCAR systems, including Cheyenne and Casper:
No modifications are needed.  Compiler executable and flags are specified in mk/system/cheyenne.make.

To prepare compilation on MacOSX:
Modify mk/system/macosx.make to specify desired compiler executable and flags.

To prepare compilation on another Unix- or Linux-based system:
Modify mk/system/default.make to specify appropriate compiler executable and flags.

Parallel compilation with MPI is enabled by default.  To compile TempestExtremes as a serial product edit "mk/config.mk" and change "PARALLEL= MPIOMP" to "PARALLEL=NONE".

Note:  If the build fails or is cancelled part way through the process, it may be necessary to remove extraneous dependency files.  To do so run "remove_depend.sh" prior to recompiling.

Installation via CMake
=====================
Using CMake, one can easily install TempestExtremes on different operational systems with the required compiler and dependencies. Dependencies can be downloaded and installed manually or via package management software (e.g., [Conda](https://docs.conda.io)) and specify environment variables to help CMake locate those dependencies (see CMake/FindNetCDF.cmake and [CMake help](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/FindMPI.html)).

General CMake configuration details:
- **Install Prefix:** Specify an installation prefix via `-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=PATH_TO_INSTALL` if desired.
- **Build Type:** Manually set the build type ("Release" or "Debug") via `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=[Release/Debug]`.
- **MPI Enable:** Manually enable or disable MPI support using `-DENABLE_MPI=ON` or `-DENABLE_MPI=OFF`.
- **Out-of-Source Build:** For best practices, build files are written to `./build/bin` by default.
- **Installation Locations:** Executables are installed to `./bin` and libraries/archives to `./lib`.

## Unix/Linux-Based Systems
Use the following commands to compile on Unix- or Linux-based systems ([netCDF](https://downloads.unidata.ucar.edu/netcdf/) required):
```
cd TEMPEST_EXTREMES_SOURCE_DIR
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=[Release/Debug] -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=PATH_TO_INSTALL -DNetCDF_PATH=NETCDF_ROOT -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=MPI_ROOT ..
make && make install
```

## Windows (Experimental)
Follow these steps to compile on the Windows system ([Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com) and [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/) required):
1. Download and install [netCDF](https://downloads.unidata.ucar.edu/netcdf/)(required) and [Microsoft MPI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/message-passing-interface/microsoft-mpi)(optional but recommended).
2. Use the following PowerShell commands to generate a Visual Studio project.
```
$Env:MSMPI_LIB64="MSMPI_SDK_ROOT/Lib/x64"
$Env:MSMPI_INC="MSMPI_SDK_ROOT/Include"
cd TEMPEST_EXTREMES_SOURCE_DIR
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -G "Visual Studio 17" -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=PATH_TO_INSTALL ..
```
3. Build the [Visual Studio project](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/building-and-cleaning-projects-and-solutions-in-visual-studio).

## HPC Systems

### NERSC Perlmutter
Use the following commands to compile on [Perlmutter](https://docs.nersc.gov/systems/perlmutter/running-jobs/):
```
module load cray-hdf5
module load cray-netcdf

cd TEMPEST_EXTREMES_SOURCE_DIR
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=[Release/Debug] -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=PATH_TO_INSTALL ..
make && make install
```


Also, a ready-to-run bash script (`./quick_make_perlmutter.sh`) is provided for building TempestExtremes on NERSC Perlmutter. This script automatically builds the project. One just needs to modify the following configuration options in the script into the desired one to run:
```
BUILD_TYPE="Debug"          # "Debug" or "Release"
ENABLE_MPI="ON"             # "ON" or "OFF"
OPTIMIZATION_LEVEL="-O0"    # Options: "-O0", "-O1", "-O2", "-O3", "-Ofast"
DEBUG_SYMBOLS="ON"          # "ON" to include debug symbols (-g), "OFF" to exclude
```
After setting the desired options, simply execute: `./quick_make_perlmutter.sh` to configure, build, and install TempestExtremes on Perlmutter.

### NCAR Derecho
Use the following commands to compile on [Derecho](https://ncar-hpc-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/compute-systems/derecho/compiling-code-on-derecho/):
```
module load ncarenv/23.09
module load ncarcompilers/1.0.0
module load intel/2023.2.1
module load cray-mpich/8.1.27
module load netcdf/4.9.2
cd TEMPEST_EXTREMES_SOURCE_DIR
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=[Release/Debug] -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=PATH_TO_INSTALL ..
make && make install
```
