# This script should be run from the root directory of the project.
# It provides a common, quick command to build the project.
# Please ensure that you have the required NetCDF package installed/loaded,
# as well as MPI packages if needed.
# For specific systems like NERSC Perlmutter, use the dedicated script (./quick_make_perlmutter.sh)
# which automatically loads the necessary modules.

# (Optional) Cleanup step 
# The build directory (./build) is used for development and debugging.
# It contains all intermediate build files and temporary artifacts.
# The final, user-deliverable executables are installed to ./bin.
# It is not recommended to mix these directories.
#
# If you are just an end user and prefer a clean structure, you can run the following lines.
# [Notes for Developers]: 
# However, if you are developing or debugging, it's better to comment out these lines
# and leave the build directory intact for faster incremental builds.
